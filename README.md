## Introduction
Welcome to my collection of ata Engineering projects! This repository houses various projects where I have applied Data engineering techniques to analyze, visualize, and derive insights from data. Throughout these projects, you may notice the use of inclusive language such as "we" and "our" in the Markdown cells of Jupyter Notebooks. It's important to note that this language is used to involve the reader (you, the employer, and potentially other collaborators) in the thought process and development journey. Whenever you encounter these terms, it's my way of inviting you to join me in exploring the project and understanding its intricacies. Rest assured, each project is entirely my own creation, and I have not copied any content from external sources.
